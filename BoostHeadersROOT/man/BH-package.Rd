  Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
  libraries with a large part implemented as template headers.
  We place a number of these libraries in this package as a more efficient
  distribution system for CRAN.  The idea is that you can write
  a package that depends on some subset of the Boost Libraries,
  yet you do not need to distribute a copy of this code with your
  package.
